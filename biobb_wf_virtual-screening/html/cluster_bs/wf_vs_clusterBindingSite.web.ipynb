    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of **protein-ligand docking**, step by step, using the **BioExcel Building Blocks library (biobb)**. The particular example used is the **Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14** (p38-α) protein (PDB code [3HEC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3HEC)), a well-known **Protein Kinase enzyme**, \n",
    " in complex with the FDA-approved **Imatinib**, (PDB Ligand code [STI](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/STI), DrugBank Ligand Code [DB00619](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00619)), a small molecule **kinase inhibitor** used to treat certain types of **cancer**. \n",
    " \n",
    "The tutorial will guide you through the process of identifying the **active site cavity** (pocket) without previous knowledge, and the final prediction of the **protein-ligand complex**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that **docking algorithms**, and in particular, **AutoDock Vina** program used in this tutorial, are **non-deterministic**. That means that results obtained when running the workflow **could be diferent** from the ones we obtained during the writing of this tutorial (see [AutoDock Vina manual](http://vina.scripps.edu/manual.html)). We invite you to try the docking process several times to verify this behaviour. \n",

    "Extracting the protein binding site(s) from the **Cluster90** collection. There are two ways in which the **Cluster90 Binding Site** can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With information about the ligand**: In this particular example we already know the **ligand** we want to dock, and also that the **PDB database** contain an **experimental structure** where the **ligand** was solved in **complex** with our protein of interest (**p38-α Tyrosine kinase**). In that case, the **ligand id** can be used to guide the **binding site** tool. <br><br>\n",
    "- **Without information about the ligand**: If the docking study starts from a **protein receptor** with no information about the **binding site** or any known **protein-ligand complex**, the **binding site** tool can not be guided. Still, the tool should be able to extract **binding site(s)** information from **similar proteins** solved with **small molecules** attached (if any).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is using the **ligand id** to guide the **binding site tool**, but we invite you to try and explore the differences in the output removing this **input information** (ligand property in the next building block).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cluster90 binding site** tool is internally running **sequence alignments** to structurally **superpose** the structures contained in the **Cluster90 collection** and extract the **residue numbering** corresponding to the **binding site** residues. Thus, **sequence alignment parameters** can be changed using building block input properties. In this example, we have chosen the well-known **blosum62** substitution matrix, with a **penalty** for opening a gap of -10.0, and a **penalty** to extend a gap of -0.5. The total number of **superimposed ligands** to be extracted from the cluster is limited at 15, and the **cut-off distance** around the ligand atoms to consider a residue to be part of a **binding site** is fixed at 5 Ångstroms."
